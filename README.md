# Express authentication template

Simple login and register form using Express, Handlebars templates, and protected routes with a logout button. Users can register, login, and access the protected route only after successful authentication. The JWT token is used for authentication and is stored as a cookie in the client's browser. When the user logs out, the token is cleared from the cookie.
